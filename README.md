# 👋 Hi, I'm Aman Shekhar

My life story weaves a rich tapestry from the intricate threads of **technology**, **chess**, and the **written word**.  
I am Aman Shekhar — a **Mobile App Developer** by profession, a **Chess Player** by heart, and an **Aspiring Author** by ambition.

From crafting scalable mobile apps to decoding chess strategies, and penning stories rooted in Indian mythology, I thrive in worlds that demand both logic and creativity. I also share my passion for technology through teaching **Data Structures and Algorithms** on YouTube. Outside the professional sphere, I indulge in reading, traveling, and literary storytelling.
